<p>The Node.js Streams is jointly governed by a Working Group
(WG)
that is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.</p>
<p>The WG has final authority over this project including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical direction</li>
<li>Project governance and process (including this policy)</li>
<li>Contribution policy</li>
<li>GitHub repository hosting</li>
<li>Conduct guidelines</li>
<li>Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators</li>
</ul>
<p>For the current list of WG members, see the project
<a href="./README.md#current-project-team-members">README.md</a>.</p>
<h3>Collaborators</h3>
<p>The readable-stream GitHub repository is
maintained by the WG and additional Collaborators who are added by the
WG on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These
individuals are identified by the WG and their addition as
Collaborators is discussed during the WG meeting.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> If you make a significant contribution and are not considered
for commit-access log an issue or contact a WG member directly and it
will be brought up in the next WG meeting.</p>
<p>Modifications of the contents of the readable-stream repository are
made on
a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a
modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a
Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full
responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed
by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required
for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators
participate and there is disagreement around a particular
modification. See <em>Consensus Seeking Process</em> below for further detail
on the consensus model used for governance.</p>
<p>Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial
modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the
WG for discussion by assigning the <em><strong>WG-agenda</strong></em> tag to a pull
request or issue. The WG should serve as the final arbiter where
required.</p>
<p>For the current list of Collaborators, see the project
<a href="./README.md#members">README.md</a>.</p>
<h3>WG Membership</h3>
<p>WG seats are not time-limited.  There is no fixed size of the WG.
However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate
coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to
make decisions efficiently.</p>
<p>There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WG
membership beyond these rules.</p>
<p>The WG may add additional members to the WG by unanimous consensus.</p>
<p>A WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or by
unanimous consensus of all other WG members.</p>
<p>Changes to WG membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be
suggested as any other agenda item (see &quot;WG Meetings&quot; below).</p>
<p>If an addition or removal is proposed during a meeting, and the full
WG is not in attendance to participate, then the addition or removal
is added to the agenda for the subsequent meeting.  This is to ensure
that all members are given the opportunity to participate in all
membership decisions.  If a WG member is unable to attend a meeting
where a planned membership decision is being made, then their consent
is assumed.</p>
<p>No more than 1/3 of the WG members may be affiliated with the same
employer.  If removal or resignation of a WG member, or a change of
employment by a WG member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of
the WG membership shares an employer, then the situation must be
immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more WG
members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).</p>
<h3>WG Meetings</h3>
<p>The WG meets occasionally on a Google Hangout On Air. A designated moderator
approved by the WG runs the meeting. Each meeting should be
published to YouTube.</p>
<p>Items are added to the WG agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, WG membership,
or release process.</p>
<p>The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.</p>
<p>Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting&apos;s agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
WG member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the <em><strong>WG-agenda</strong></em> tag to the issue.</p>
<p>Prior to each WG meeting the moderator will share the Agenda with
members of the WG. WG members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the WG
cannot veto or remove items.</p>
<p>The WG may invite persons or representatives from certain projects to
participate in a non-voting capacity.</p>
<p>The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.</p>
<h3>Consensus Seeking Process</h3>
<p>The WG follows a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Consensus
Seeking</a>
decision-making model.</p>
<p>When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator
will ask &quot;Does anyone object?&quot; as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.</p>
<p>If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a WG member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next
meeting. The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the WG
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins.</p>
<p>Note that changes to WG membership require a majority consensus.  See
&quot;WG Membership&quot; above.</p>
